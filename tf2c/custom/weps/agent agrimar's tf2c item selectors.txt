Hi! Still me here.

This is an "official" so to speak thing, just deactivated by default - these turn the Item Selection from a big, vertical list, into a smaller grid.

Agent Agrimar, one of TF2C's developers, posted this a while ago, early in the #community-discussion channel's life, and stated it was intended for use
when there were a larger bevy of items in TF2C at some point.

I've had a lot of people ask me for this before, so I decided to package it in with this version of the mod for once.
Bear in mind this is NOT MY creation, it's an official TF2C thing!
